    <h2>Intention to make use of Firebase</h2>
    <p>
      This web app will use Firebase to handle authentication and usage as a backend database with Firestore.
      It will allow users to signup and login. It will also allow users to be able to save movies that are listed on the browser which is handled by the administrator who synces movie data using an API into the database.
      Firestore will also be used for an initial configuration collection which stores the movies to display in a slideshow, and holds the synced movie collection data. The administrator will be in charge of searching for new movie keywords from the API and storing those document objects into the database. The frontend will then hold the movies on a directory page for users to save and vote on.
